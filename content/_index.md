## Understanding the Concept

The Metacrisis is not just another crisis. It is the underlying, systemic dysfunction
that connects climate change, political polarization, mental health epidemics,
and economic instability. It's a failure in our collective sense-making,
our values, and our institutions to adequately perceive and respond to
the complexity of the challenges we have created.

Understanding it is the first step toward developing the new frameworks
and inner capacities required for a regenerative future.
