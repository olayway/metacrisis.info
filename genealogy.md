title: "Metacrisis: Conceptual History and Key Thinkers"
---

Throughout the recent decade, the concept of metacrisis has developed steadily, and the term has grown in popularity. With thanks to [Jonah Wilberg](https://lifeitselfresearch.substack.com/p/jonah-wilberg-on-the-metacrisis) for his research, the timeline below plots some key developments - asking forgiveness from the many thinkers in the related ecosystem whose contribution is missing or truncated.

# Deep Antecedents (Pre-2010)

**Marxist Tradition (19th–20th c.)**: Karl Marx theorised economic structures as underlying multiple crises - an early “meta-crisis” concept (though not named so). Gramsci’s “organic crisis,” Althusser’s ideology, and Habermas’s legitimation crisis invoked comparable cultural-political layers.

**Phenomenological/Cultural Tradition (19th–20th c.)**: Nietzsche (nihilism), Spengler (Decline of the West), Husserl (Crisis of the European Sciences), Heidegger (Question Concerning Technology), Adorno, Jonas - all frame civilizational breakdown as cultural or ontological crisis, often linked to technological modernity.

**Consciousness Evolution tradition**: writers like Sri Aurobindo and Jean Gebser develop the idea of major shifts in human consciousness and worldview and their association with critical points in human history. Later directly influential upon Ken Wilber and the Integral movement. 

**Club of Rome (1972) Limits to Growth**: Used terms like “meta-problem” or “meta-system of problems”. 

**Donella Meadows (1999) Leverage Points**: A founding member of the Club of Rome,  Meadows considered the deepest leverage point for system change to be the mindset or worldview from which the system arises.
