# The anatomy of Metacrisis  
Locating the roots of global crises in the foundations of modern culture

**Metacrisis:**   
*A crisis in the dominant cultural paradigm: a multi-systemic breakdown rooted in the deep worldviews, values and assumptions that reciprocally shape modern civilization.*

*A new white paper offers a basic on-ramp to the language of metacrisis: what it is, how it relates to polycrisis, and why it matters.* 

**In short**

As proliferating threats converge towards potential catastrophe, humanity is reaching for new ways to understand multi-systemic breakdown \- and language to describe it. The term **polycrisis** has entered common use; naming an entanglement of crises and their cascading interactions. But an emerging field of thinkers insists that this framing doesn’t reach deeply enough. The concept of **Metacrisis** points to foundational conditions that generate all of our manifest systemic failures. In the simplest possible terms, *much as symptoms signal an underlying illness, polycrisis points to metacrisis.* 

What might be the source of this deep civilizational dysfunction? The nascent field of metacrisis thought explores the ways in which dominant **worldviews**, particularly within the **modern cultural paradigm**, ultimately produce and reinforce multi-systemic breakdown. From climate chaos to AI risk and war, polycrisis effects can always be rethought as symptoms of metacrisis. 

*“The metacrisis...lives within us, between us and beyond us, and to some extent defines us.”*  
 – Jonathan Rowson

*“The metacrisis is a complex, multifaceted gestalt or “laminated system.”*   
– Nicholas Hedlund

*“The metacrisis... has to do with how humans understand themselves and the world... systems and societies are in trouble, but it is the psyche that is in the direst of straits.*  
– Zak Stein

**Metacrisis thinking in 3 (simplified) steps**

1 Underpinning all cultural behaviours \- including the patterns that produce crises \- are foundational assumptions about reality, and what it means to be human.

2 Within modern cultures empowered by industrial progress and scientific revolution, a reductive worldview of *separateness\** \- and corresponding zero-sum values of control and competition \- has come to structure our shared sense of reality.

3 The institutional structures shaped by these views and values reinforce their divisive logic \- amplifying extractive behaviours, justifying harmful ‘externalities’, and generating the coordination failures that now threaten catastrophe on multiple dimensions.

4 So, for example, failure of multilateral institutions to limit climate breakdown reflects a collective action problem, driven by competition among individualised nations and peoples: each prioritising its own economy and way of life at the expense of the global good.

*\*A worldview of separateness?*

A crucial piece of the puzzle. Among theorists of metacrisis, separateness is a foundational theme: a dominant way of seeing that reduces the whole world to a sum of inanimate parts \- treating the smallest parts as most fundamental. This way of seeing the world has naturally been amplified throughout an era empowered by machines and empirical science, grounded in units of measurement. A corresponding individualist mindset lies at the root of all dominance paradigms \- man over nature; me against you. 

What’s the alternative? A view that understands reality as fundamentally interconnected, interdependent, whole and alive \- giving rise to reverence for life, nature and other beings within complex living systems. 

Highly influential in this regard is the work of Iain McGilchrist; who shows how these two modes of attending to reality arise naturally from the brain’s specialised, divided hemispheres. The left hemisphere’s ability to model a world in discrete parts has allowed modern humans to to manipulate the world with extraordinary effectiveness, shaping institutions and cultural behaviours that reinforce its dominance. But, Mcgilchrist warns, this view by itself is fatally deficient. It produces destruction in a world that is truly complex, dynamic and relational \- a reality more faithfully apprehended by the right hemisphere. A healthy culture, he suggests, would restore hierarchy: the analytic talents of the left hemisphere subservient to the right’s holistic relationship with reality.
