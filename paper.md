## Abstract

The system transformation needed to address our interconnected crises requires a shift at the level of collective worldview. Towards such a shift - and the resilience and flourishing needed to navigate societal breakdowns wisely and create the new - we offer a model of Developmental Spaces (DS):

> **Dedicated, growth-oriented spaces where communities engage in sustained, multi-domain inner development in the service of cultural transformation.** 

The paper that follows outlines a rationale for inner development and the spaces of community that can support it. We set out the qualities of these spaces and offer recommendations for field building and practical implementation.

We aim to help build an evidence-based movement for Developmental Spaces, provided widely enough to serve large segments of populations. The ultimate ambition is a replicable, scalable model with potential to influence the deepest orientation of societies towards a regenerative future.

> *“I think hard times are coming, when we will be wanting voices… who can see alternatives to how we live now, and can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies, to other ways of being.”* – Ursula K Le Guin (2014)
