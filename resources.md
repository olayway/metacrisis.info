# What's Next? Resources & Pathways

Understanding the metacrisis as a deep, foundational challenge is the first step. The next is to explore the pathways of response.

The work of Life Itself and related communities focuses on a synthesized approach, addressing the crisis at three interconnected levels: the **Inner**, the **Social** (or Inter-personal), and the **Cultural** (or Systemic).

Here are key resources and initiatives to explore each of these pathways.

## 1. The Inner Response: Cultivating Wisdom

The metacrisis is an "inside-out" problem. This pathway focuses on the inner development—the contemplative practices, emotional maturity, and cognitive complexity—required for us to show up with the wisdom to face our challenges.

* **[Contemplation at Life Itself](https://lifeitself.org/contemplation)**: An introduction to the "why" and "how" of contemplative practice as a response.
* **[The 'Inner' Dimension](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022-07-06-mapping-the-metacrisis-and-polycrisis)**: A blog post that maps the "inner" aspects of the metacrisis, including the failure of our sense-making.

## 2. The Social Response: Building New Ways of Living

If our old social structures are failing, we must experiment with new ones. This pathway is about building new models for community, governance, and economics, starting with how we live together.

* **[Developmental Spaces](https://developmentalspaces.org/)**: A major Life Itself initiative to create a network of "conscious coliving" spaces. These are physical hubs dedicated to fostering community and personal development as a direct response to the metacrisis.
* **[Life Itself Community](https://lifeitself.org/community)**: Learn about and connect with the broader community, both online and in-person.

## 3. The Cultural Response: A Second Renaissance

This pathway addresses the "worldview" and "values" at the heart of the metacrisis. It's about developing the new philosophy, art, and "cultural operating system" for a wiser, weller world.

* **[Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/)**: The LI hub dedicated to this cultural shift. It features a "Lexicon" of new ideas, articles, and podcasts exploring the new paradigms needed to navigate the 21st century.
