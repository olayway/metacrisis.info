# What's Next? Resources & Pathways

Understanding the metacrisis as a deep, foundational challenge is the first step. The next is to explore the pathways of response.

The work of Life Itself and related communities focuses on a synthesized approach, addressing the crisis at three interconnected levels: the **Inner**, the **Social** (or Inter-personal), and the **Cultural** (or Systemic).

Here are key resources and initiatives to explore these primary pathways.

## 1. The Inner Response: Cultivating Wisdom

This pathway focuses on the inner development—the contemplative practices, emotional maturity, and cognitive complexity—required for us to show up with the wisdom to face our complex challenges.

* **[Contemplation at Life Itself](https://lifeitself.org/contemplation)**: An introduction to the "why" and "how" of contemplative practice as a response.
* **[The 'Inner' Dimension](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022-07-06-mapping-the-metacrisis-and-polycrisis)**: A blog post that maps the "inner" aspects of the metacrisis, including the failure of our sense-making.

## 2. The Social Response: Building New Ways of Living

This pathway is about building new models for community, governance, and economics, starting with how we live together.

* **[Developmental Spaces](https://developmentalspaces.org/)**: A major Life Itself initiative to create a network of "conscious coliving" spaces dedicated to fostering community and personal development.
* **[Life Itself Community](https://lifeitself.org/community)**: Learn about and connect with the broader community, both online and in-person.

## 3. The Cultural Response: A Second Renaissance

This pathway addresses the "worldview" and "values" at the heart of the metacrisis. It's about developing the new philosophy, art, and "cultural operating system" for a wiser, weller world.

* **[Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/)**: The LI hub dedicated to this cultural shift, featuring a "Lexicon" of new ideas, articles, and podcasts.
